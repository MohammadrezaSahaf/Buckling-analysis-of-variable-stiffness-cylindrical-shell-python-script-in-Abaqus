# Buckling-analysis-of-variable-stiffness-cylindrical-shell-python-script-in-Abaqus
This python script is part of a project for optimization of variable stiffness cylindrical shells through artificial intelligence techniques
This script is used for calculating the buckling load of a variable stiffness cylindrical shell 
This is the simplified version of a project which you can find more about it in the below conference paper
